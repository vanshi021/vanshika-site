          <h3>A Rookie Designer</h3>
          <p class="mainpara">
            Before I could even walk, I was handed paints instead of toys.
            Creativity wasnâ€™t just encouragedâ€”it was my first language. From
            early memories of painting to years spent mastering Bharatanatyam,
            expression became second nature. Even when I shifted pathsâ€”from
            performing arts to business studiesâ€”creativity found its way back
            through design. What started as hand-drawn logos turned into a
            journey of self-taught skills, professional work, and eventually,
            design school. Each twist in the path has helped me see the world a
            little differentlyâ€”and design, for me, has always been about seeing
            deeply. <br />
            <i>
              Curious by nature, creative by choiceâ€”I'm still exploring, still
              learning.

        Hey there, curious human! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my little corner of the internet
        â€” part portfolio, part personality, and fully me. This isnâ€™t just
        another website dedicated to self. This is where pixels meet passion,
        where creativity gets a caffeine boost, and where you get to know the
        work, the quirks, and the chaos behind the person (hi, thatâ€™s me ðŸ‘€). So
        scroll around, click a few things, and if something makes you smile or
        think â€” my job here is done (but donâ€™t worry, thereâ€™s more to see)! Take
        your time, wander through the details, and donâ€™t be afraid to get a
        little lost. Every page holds a piece of my journey, and maybe even a
        spark for yours. Ready? Letâ€™s explore together.
