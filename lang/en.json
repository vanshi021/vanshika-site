  "welcome": "Welcome!",
 "intro-para": " Before I could even walk, I was handed paints instead of toys.
            Creativity wasn’t just encouraged—it was my first language. From
            early memories of painting to years spent mastering Bharatanatyam,
            expression became second nature. Even when I shifted paths—from
            performing arts to business studies—creativity found its way back
            through design. What started as hand-drawn logos turned into a
            journey of self-taught skills, professional work, and eventually,
            design school. Each twist in the path has helped me see the world a
            little differently—and design, for me, has always been about seeing
            deeply. <br />

              Curious by nature, creative by choice—I'm still exploring, still
              learning."
