          <p>
            Before I even learned to walk, I was handed colours and paints. My
            parents believed that creativity wasn’t just a skill—it was a way
            thinking, of feeling, of being. So instead of toys, I was given
            brushes. Paper became my playground, and that’s where my journey
            truly began. <br />
            As I grew, my curiosity took many forms. One of the most defining
            was dance. At just six years old, I was enrolled in a Bharatanatyam
            academy. What began as an after-school routine slowly became one of
            the biggest milestones of my life. Over ten years of discipline,
            training, and performance, I earned a degree in performing arts even
            before finishing high school. But what I gained was so much more
            than technique. Bharatanatyam taught me confidence. It shaped the
            way I carry myself, the way I enter rooms, and the way I believe in
            my own presence. It taught me the grace to hold myself with dignity
            and the resilience to move through life with a rhythm of my own.<br />
            In 12th grade, I began training for design colleges—but life, as it
            often does, nudged me in another direction. I shifted to a BBA
            program, thinking maybe the creative world was something I’d left
            behind. But creativity always finds its way back. During course in
            advertising, we were asked to work with real clients. I found one
            who needed office stationery, and although I had no formal design
            experience, I ended up drawing a logo by hand. Translating that into
            a digital version was a struggle, but in that challenge, I
            discovered just how alive I felt while creating. That moment sparked
            something in me—and it never really left. <br />
            After graduation—and in the stillness that the Covid years
            unexpectedly brought—I had time to breathe and think. I started
            learning Illustrator, Photoshop, and other design tools on my own.
            Those self-taught skills soon led me to a job as a junior graphic
            designer at a branding agency. That experience was eye-opening. I
            realized that design isn’t just about what you make—it’s about the
            thinking that comes before. The software is the easy part; the real
            work is in the ideas, the people, the research. That understanding
            shifted my entire approach. <br />
            My curiosity deepened, and it led me to Ahmedabad University, where
            I worked as a teaching associate in the design department. That
            chapter of my life gave me more than just work experience—it gave me
            mentors who saw potential in me and encouraged me to take my next
            step. And that’s how I came to DAU to pursue communication design,
            fully stepping into a space that had always been calling to me.
            <br />
            Design school changed how I think. Those things I used to wonder
            about—how do people create such impactful visuals? What goes into
            making an idea real?—those questions started finding answers.
            Slowly, the fog lifted, and what once felt distant became doable.
            <br />
            Outside of design, I’m someone who loves to keep learning. I get
            restless doing the same thing for too long, so I’m always looking
            for something new to explore. I believe shifting paths is okay—it’s
            part of how I grow. I embrace change when it comes to learning,
            though in my personal life, I like a little more stability. As a
            Libra, I’m famously indecisive, and I think that trait has guided
            many of the twists and turns in my journey so far. <br />
            I love people. I hate being alone, and I find joy in surrounding
            myself with company, in hearing stories, and in connecting with
            different kinds of minds. I believe people carry the kind of wisdom
            no textbook can teach. I’ve also grown to love observation. During
            my bachelor’s, I once watched a short film that said something that
            stayed with me forever: “There is no time when nothing is happening
            around—you just need to be focused enough to read the silence.” That
            line changed the way I see the world. Since then, I’ve tried to stay
            present, to notice the quiet details, the unspoken moments. That’s
            where inspiration lives. And that’s where I find myself, over and
            over again.

            I’m still learning—with every click, sketch, and mistake. I started
            with curiosity, and I’m staying for the love of the process. I
            believe that trying matters more than getting it right the first
            time. My designs are small steps in a long journey. I design because
            it helps me understand the world—and myself. I don’t always know
            where I’m going—but I show up, every day. Growth is slow, but it’s
            real—and I’m proud of it. I’m not here to be perfect. I’m here to be
            better than yesterday.

        Hey there, curious human! 👋 Welcome to my little corner of the internet
        — part portfolio, part personality, and fully me. This isn’t just
        another website dedicated to self. This is where pixels meet passion,
        where creativity gets a caffeine boost, and where you get to know the
        work, the quirks, and the chaos behind the person (hi, that’s me 👀). So
        scroll around, click a few things, and if something makes you smile or
        think — my job here is done (but don’t worry, there’s more to see)! Take
        your time, wander through the details, and don’t be afraid to get a
        little lost. Every page holds a piece of my journey, and maybe even a
        spark for yours. Ready? Let’s explore together.
