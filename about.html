            <i>And this is my story: <br /></i>
            Before I even learned to walk, I was handed colours and paints. My
            parents believed that creativity wasn’t just a skill—it was a way
            thinking, of feeling, of being. So instead of toys, I was given
            brushes. Paper became my playground, and that’s where my journey
            truly began. <br />
            As I grew, my curiosity took many forms. One of the most defining
            was dance. At just six years old, I was enrolled in a Bharatanatyam
            academy. What began as an after-school routine slowly became one of
            the biggest milestones of my life. Over ten years of discipline,
            training, and performance, I earned a degree in performing arts even
            before finishing high school. But what I gained was so much more
            than technique. Bharatanatyam taught me confidence. It shaped the
            way I carry myself, the way I enter rooms, and the way I believe in
            my own presence. It taught me the grace to hold myself with dignity
            and the resilience to move through life with a rhythm of my own.<br />

      <h2>MANIFESTO</h2>
      <p>
        I’m still learning—with every click, sketch, and mistake. I started with
        curiosity, and I’m staying for the love of the process. I believe that
        trying matters more than getting it right the first time. My designs are
        small steps in a long journey. I design because it helps me understand
        the world—and myself. I don’t always know where I’m going—but I show up,
        every day. Growth is slow, but it’s real—and I’m proud of it. I’m not
        here to be perfect. I’m here to be better than yesterday.

      <p data-key="intro-para">
        In 12th grade, I began training for design colleges—but life, as it
        often does, nudged me in another direction. I shifted to a BBA program,
        thinking maybe the creative world was something I’d left behind. But
        creativity always finds its way back. During course in advertising, we
        were asked to work with real clients. I found one who needed office
        stationery, and although I had no formal design experience, I ended up
        drawing a logo by hand. Translating that into a digital version was a
        struggle, but in that challenge, I discovered just how alive I felt
        while creating. That moment sparked something in me—and it never really
        left. <br />
        After graduation—and in the stillness that the Covid years unexpectedly
        brought—I had time to breathe and think. I started learning Illustrator,
        Photoshop, and other design tools on my own. Those self-taught skills
        soon led me to a job as a junior graphic designer at a branding agency.
        That experience was eye-opening. I realized that design isn’t just about
        what you make—it’s about the thinking that comes before. The software is
        the easy part; the real work is in the ideas, the people, the research.
        That understanding shifted my entire approach. <br />
        My curiosity deepened, and it led me to Ahmedabad University, where I
        worked as a teaching associate in the design department. That chapter of
        my life gave me more than just work experience—it gave me mentors who
        saw potential in me and encouraged me to take my next step. And that’s
        how I came to DAU to pursue communication design, fully stepping into a
        space that had always been calling to me.
        <br />
        Design school changed how I think. Those things I used to wonder
        about—how do people create such impactful visuals? What goes into making
        an idea real?—those questions started finding answers. Slowly, the fog
        lifted, and what once felt distant became doable.
        <br />
        Outside of design, I’m someone who loves to keep learning. I get
        restless doing the same thing for too long, so I’m always looking for
        something new to explore. I believe shifting paths is okay—it’s part of
        how I grow. I embrace change when it comes to learning, though in my
        personal life, I like a little more stability. As a Libra, I’m famously
        indecisive, and I think that trait has guided many of the twists and
        turns in my journey so far. <br />
        I love people. I hate being alone, and I find joy in surrounding myself
        with company, in hearing stories, and in connecting with different kinds
        of minds. I believe people carry the kind of wisdom no textbook can
        teach. I’ve also grown to love observation. During my bachelor’s, I once
        watched a short film that said something that stayed with me forever:
        “There is no time when nothing is happening around—you just need to be
        focused enough to read the silence.” That line changed the way I see the
        world. Since then, I’ve tried to stay present, to notice the quiet
        details, the unspoken moments. That’s where inspiration lives. And
        that’s where I find myself, over and over again.
