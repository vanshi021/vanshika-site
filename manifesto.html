            I’m still learning — with every click, every sketch, and every
            <br />mistake that teaches me something new. I didn’t step into
            design knowing exactly where I wanted to go. I started with
            curiosity — the kind that makes you wonder what if? — and I’ve
            stayed because of the love I’ve found in the process. I believe that
            trying matters more than getting it right the first time. Perfection
            can wait; progress cannot. Every design I create is just one step
            forward, a small mark in a much longer journey. Some steps feel
            effortless, others feel like uphill climbs, but each one leaves me a
            little stronger, a little wiser. <br />Design, for me, is more than
            just arranging shapes, colors, and type. It’s a way of understanding
            the world — and in the process, understanding myself. My work is a
            conversation: between my ideas and my tools, between my eyes and my
            heart, and between my imagination and the people who see it. I don’t
            always know where I’m going, but I’ve learned that showing up —
            every single day — matters more than having a perfect map.
            <br />Growth is slow, but it’s real. It lives in the details, in the
            quiet “aha” moments, in the gentle confidence that wasn’t there
            yesterday. I’m not here to be perfect. I’m here to be better than
            yesterday. And tomorrow, I’ll show up again — with the same
            curiosity, the same love for the process, and the same belief that
            the journey is just as important as the destination.

            <br />
            <br />
            Some stories are told in words. Mine is told in pixels, colors, and
            little experiments that refuse to sit still. This website began as
            an experiment — my way of carving out a small corner on the internet
            that feels like me. It’s not just a portfolio, not just a resume,
            and not just a scrapbook of past work. It’s a space that tells a
            story — my story — through the things I create, the lessons I’ve
            learned, and the little bits of myself I’ve decided to share.
            <br />When I started building this, I thought the goal was to have a
            finished, polished site that would speak for me. But somewhere along
            the way, I realised something: the final product is never the whole
            truth. The real story lives in the process — in the small changes,
            the quiet progress, and the way ideas evolve over time. So this site
            is not a final statement; it’s a living, growing reflection of me.
            It carries my experiments, my mistakes, my improvements, and my
            milestones. Some pages may feel more complete than others, some
            sections may feel like works-in-progress — and that’s intentional.
            Because I’m still learning, still exploring, still building. I want
            this website to be more than a place where you see my work — I want
            it to be a place where you can feel my journey.<br />
            To understand that every design, every word, every choice here is a
            step forward, however small. If you’re here, I hope you see more
            than a collection of projects. I hope you see growth. I hope you see
            curiosity. I hope you see the love for the craft, not just the craft
            itself. This is my process. This is my progress. And I’m inviting
            you to walk through it with me. Because at the end of the day, my
            work isn’t just what I make — it’s who I become while making it.
