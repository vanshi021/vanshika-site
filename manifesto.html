            <i>And this is my story: <br></i>
            Before I even learned to walk, I was handed colours and paints. My
            parents believed that creativity wasn’t just a skill—it was a way
            thinking, of feeling, of being. So instead of toys, I was given
            brushes. Paper became my playground, and that’s where my journey
            truly began. <br />
            As I grew, my curiosity took many forms. One of the most defining
            was dance. At just six years old, I was enrolled in a Bharatanatyam
            academy. What began as an after-school routine slowly became one of
            the biggest milestones of my life. Over ten years of discipline,
            training, and performance, I earned a degree in performing arts even
            before finishing high school. But what I gained was so much more
            than technique. Bharatanatyam taught me confidence. It shaped the
            way I carry myself, the way I enter rooms, and the way I believe in
            my own presence. It taught me the grace to hold myself with dignity
            and the resilience to move through life with a rhythm of my own.<br />
